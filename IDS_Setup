IDS â€“ OpenCanary


Command:

git clone https://github.com/thinkst/opencanary
cd opencanary
sudo python3 setup.py install


Next, run the following command to create a sample config file to the canary to edit:
opencanaryd --copyconfig

We need to configure the conf file in order to enable specific attack detection service.
We have attached our config file opencanary.conf

Then finally, run canary with the following:
opencanaryd --start
