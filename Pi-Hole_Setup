Pi-Hole

Method 1 (Automated Installer)
curl -sSL https://install.pi-hole.net | bash

Method 2 (Download and Execute)
wget -O basic-install.sh https://install.pi-hole.net
sudo bash basic-install.sh

Any settings we configure during installation can be updated later. 
At some point, it asks us to select an upstream DNS provider. This is the server on which lookups of non-blocked hostnames will be performed.

Then, it will ask to select an adlist. leave the default on. Later, we can add more lists, including custom ones.

When the installation is finished, we get a summary message that includes the IP addresses of the Pi-hole and the randomly generated admin password.

To be sure the installation succeeded, open a web browser and go to http://IP_ADDRESS/admin, where IP_ADDRESS is the IPv4 address of the Pi-hole device. 
Note that the http://pihole/admin only works after we setup device to use the Pi-hole DNS server. Click on log-in and enter (randomly-generated) password. 

 
Now that we have Pi-hole installed, the last step is configuring network to use Pi-hole as its DNS server

The preferred method for doing this is to change our router's DNS server and point it to the Pi-hole IP address, ensuring any client that connects to the network receives the Pi-hole as its DNS server. Typically this requires us to access the router's administration panel. There, we should have a field to set the primary and secondary DNS servers. Set the primary address to the Pi-hole's IP address, and reset any open network connection we may have on the devices. Now, when we connect to home network, we should get the Pi-hole as the DNS server.
