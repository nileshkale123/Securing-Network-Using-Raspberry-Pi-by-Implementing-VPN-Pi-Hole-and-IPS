Pi-VPN

Step 1

Open the terminal and run the following command
curl -L https://install.pivpn.io | bash

Then it will prompt with a dialog box and will be asked with a few questions on 
setting up the OpenVPN server. Here we will choose the default settings because it is 
enough to make the server up and running.

Creating a client ovpn profile
Now that the server is running, we need to configure the clients which will be 
connecting to the server. In order to do this, we need to generate an ovpn profile for 
each and every client that will be accessing server.


Run the following command to add a client
pivpn add

Then proceed with entering a client name, number of days the certificate would last, 
and a password.When client profiles are added, they get stored under /home/user/ovpns directory.


Now that we have a .ovpn file for device, we need to install the necessary software on 
the client in order to use this file. OpenVPN Connect is the recommended software to 
use on all iOS, Android, macOS, Linux and Windows devices.
