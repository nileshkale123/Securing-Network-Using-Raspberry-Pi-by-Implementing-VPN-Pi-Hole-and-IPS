In this project, we are implementing a VPN server on a Raspberry Pi that is capable of encrypting the end-to-end connection between a user’s device to servers so that the attacker cannot intercept the data and also providing anonymity to the end user in the network. Also, a Pi-Hole is integrated to block advertisements at the user’s device. Pi-Hole works as a DNS sinkhole that blocks the queries containing advertisements from being forwarded to the internet, unlike ad-block which can only hide the advertisements and only work with supported browsers. To add better security, IDS is also implemented on Raspberry-pi through which users are connected to VPN and Pi-hole. IDS detects known attacks like portscan, unauthorised SSH remote login attempt etc.

The Raspberry Pi 3 B was equipped with Raspbian as its Operating System. After the installation for the OS is finished, remote connection features were set up to ease user jobs to maintain the Raspberry Pi and to create the bridge connection between public Wi-Fi access (IIT H Guest) and user’s device.

We have added setup and installation command for the Pi-Hole, Pi-VPN and IDS opencanary. We have also attached the config file of IDS opencanary.
